# Exercise 1: Docker basics

This exercise will make sure you understand the fundamental concepts of Docker and end with you running the Docker "Hello World" on your laptop.

You don't need to have Docker installed to complete this exercise.

## What is Docker?

Before we dive into Docker and get our hands dirty, you should know a little about how Docker works - especially how Docker is different than Virtual Machines.

> If you have attended one of my "Introduction to Docker" talks before, you already have the background you need. You can skip to the next section.

You can start by reading the official ["What is it?"](https://www.docker.com/whatisdocker/) page on Docker.com.

If you want more information, you can check out the ["What is Docker?"](http://player.oreilly.com/videos/9781491916179?toc_id=197359) chapter from my [O'Reilly video tutorial](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920035732.do), which is available for free.

## Docker commands crash course

There's no better place to write your first Docker commands than with the official Docker tutorial: https://www.docker.com/tryit/

It will only take you a few minutes to complete it, but you'll get a taste of the main commands you will use for the rest of this tutorial.

## Dockerfiles 101

Dockerfiles are a very important Docker concept. They allow you to easily compose and modify your own custom Docker images.

Skim [DigitalOcean's Dockerfile primer](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/docker-explained-using-dockerfiles-to-automate-building-of-images). Don't worry if you don't understand it all - just try to get the gist of it.

You're now ready to move to [Exercise 2](exercise-2.md) as soon as Docker is installed on your laptop.
